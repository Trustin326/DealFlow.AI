# DealFlow AI — Live Demo Site (Static)
This package includes a GitHub Pages–ready landing page and four interactive demos:
- Lead Vault (`demo/lead-vault.html`) — localStorage-based lead manager
- Proposal Builder (`demo/proposal-builder.html`) — proposal preview generator
- Follow‑Up AI (`demo/followup-ai.html`) — tone templates for quick outreach
- Commission Tracker (`demo/commission-tracker.html`) — sum commissions client-side

## Deploy
1) Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., DealFlowAI-Demo).
2) Upload the contents of this ZIP to the root.
3) Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main / root.
4) Visit: https://YOURNAME.github.io/DealFlowAI-Demo/

## Notes
- All demo data is stored locally on the visitor's device (localStorage). No backend, no compliance.
- Replace Stripe links in `index.html` under the Pricing section.
